## Rationale

Commonly people use HAProxy software acting as a load balancer to spread load
between multiple machines within a serving cluster and handle failures
gracefully. With amqpprox we built a similar proxy, except tailored
specifically for the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol. This brings benefits which cannot
be achieved with layer 4 proxying alone.

This proxy and how we use it was first publicly outlined in [this
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTh1nIKEOU4) at RabbitMQ Summit 2019, then
released & introduced in detail in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2hQ8glQyhs)
at RabbitMQ Summit 2021.

### Key Advantages

1. We can redirect different virtual hosts to different broker clusters
2. We are able to understand/log AMQP 0.9.1 sessions passing through the proxy
3. We can alter which brokers are connected to, in order to optimise network/datacenter
   cross-traffic.
4. We can get detailed statistics without relying on the RabbitMQ broker itself
5. We can easily have clients test connection failovers locally

- [X] Unix domain socket for control plane operations
- [X] Allow switching connections between farms per vhost
- [X] Load balancing between the farm members
- [X] Resources (vhosts) can be pointed at DNS farms, not just IPs
- [X] Statistics about each interaction
- [X] Able to easily test client failover by severing connections on demand


## Getting Started
### Quick Start 

This guide assumes you have amqpprox [building](#building), and a RabbitMQ broker running on `locahost:5672`.

`amqpprox` can be started with a few command line arguments to start in a simple one mapping mode:

```
$ amqpprox --consoleVerbosity 5 --destinationDNS localhost --destinationPort 5672 --listenPort 5673
Starting amqpprox, logging to: 'logs' control using: '/tmp/amqpprox'
TRACE: Session cleanup starting
TRACE: Clean up finished with no sessions to clean up
...<snip>...
```

You can then connect your RabbitMQ client via `localhost:5673` and `amqpprox`
will proxy all connections into `5673` to the running broker on `5672`. Until
you make a connection you won't see much other than periodic cleanup trace, but
you can interact with it fully through the `amqpprox_ctl` interface.

This mode is designed for simple use cases where a user is using only one vhost or
wants to do local-only testing.

### Getting Started With `amqpprox_ctl` commands

`amqpprox` is the core proxy executable. By default it starts up with no mapped
vhosts/broker backends/listening ports/other configuration. `amqpprox_ctl` is
used to provide configuration before telling it to begin listening. See [amqpprox_ctl documentation](https://github.com/bloomberg/amqpprox/blob/main/docs/config.md).

### Start `amqpprox`
```
$ amqpprox --help
amqpprox AMQP v0.9.1 proxy:

This is a proxy program for AMQP v0.9.1, designed to sit in front of a RabbitMQ
cluster. Most options for configuring the proxy and introspecting its state are
available through the amqpprox_ctl program, begin by sending 'HELP' to it.

This program supports the following options to allow running multiple instances
on a machine and a simplified configuration mode. In the simplified
configuration mode the --listenPort, --destinationDNS and --destinationPort
must all be specified, and after which it immediately starts listening on all
interfaces for that port and sends all vhosts to the destination DNS entry.
More complicated configuration, such as sending different vhosts to different
destinations, necessitates the use of the amqpprox_ctl.

Although most configuration is injected by the amqpprox_ctl program, the
logging directories and the control UNIX domain socket are specified on this
program, to facilitate safely running multiple instances of amqpprox on a
single host.  
:
  --help                               This help information
  --logDirectory arg (=logs)           Set logging directory
  --controlSocket arg (=/tmp/amqpprox) Set control UNIX domain socket location
  --cleanupIntervalMs arg (=1000)      Set the cleanup interval to garbage
                                       collect connections
  --listenPort arg (=0)                Simple config mode: listening port
  --destinationPort arg (=0)           Simple config mode: destination port
  --destinationDNS arg                 Simple config mode: destination DNS
                                       address
  -v [ --consoleVerbosity ] arg (=0)   Default console logging verbosity (0 =
                                       No output through to 5 = Trace-level)
                                       
$ amqpprox
Starting amqpprox, logging to: 'logs' control using: '/tmp/amqpprox'
```

### `amqpprox_ctl` Example Usage

```sh
$ amqpprox_ctl --help
Usage: amqpprox_ctl <control_socket> ARGS
```

`amqpprox` responds to HELP

```
$ amqpprox_ctl /tmp/amqpprox HELP
BACKEND (ADD name datacenter host port [SEND-PROXY] [TLS] | ADD_DNS name datacenter address port [SEND-PROXY] [TLS] | DELETE name | PRINT) - Change backend servers
CONN Print the connected sessions
DATACENTER SET name | PRINT
EXIT Exit the program gracefully.
FARM (ADD name selector backend* | PARTITION name policy | DELETE name | PRINT) - Change farms
HELP Print this help text.
LISTEN START port | START_SECURE port | STOP [port]
LOG CONSOLE verbosity | FILE verbosity
MAP (BACKEND vhost backend | FARM vhost name | UNMAP vhost | DEFAULT farmName | REMOVE_DEFAULT | PRINT) - Change mappings of resources to servers
MAPHOSTNAME DNS - Set up mapping of IPs to hostnames
SESSION  id# (PAUSE|DISCONNECT_GRACEFUL|FORCE_DISCONNECT) - Control a particular session
STAT (STOP SEND | SEND <host> <port> | (LISTEN (json|human) (overall|vhost=foo|backend=bar|source=baz|all|process|bufferpool)) - Output statistics
TLS (INGRESS | EGRESS) (KEY_FILE file | CERT_CHAIN_FILE file | RSA_KEY_FILE file | TMP_DH_FILE file | CA_CERT_FILE file | VERIFY_MODE mode* | CIPHERS (PRINT | SET ciphersuite(:ciphersuite)*))
VHOST PAUSE vhost | UNPAUSE vhost | PRINT | BACKEND_DISCONNECT vhost | FORCE_DISCONNECT vhost
```

Configure `amqpprox` how to talk to an AMQP 0.9.1 backend called `rabbit1`, labelled as datacenter `london-az1`, running on `localhost:5672` without TLS/Proxy Protocol.
```
$ amqpprox_ctl /tmp/amqpprox BACKEND ADD rabbit1 london-az1 localhost 5672
$ amqpprox_ctl /tmp/amqpprox BACKEND PRINT
rabbit1 (london-az1): localhost 127.0.0.1:5672
```

Configure `amqpprox` to map inbound connections for `vhost-example` to backend `rabbit1`
```
$ amqpprox_ctl /tmp/amqpprox MAP BACKEND vhost-example rabbit1
$ amqpprox_ctl /tmp/amqpprox MAP PRINT
"vhost-example" => Backend:rabbit1
```

`amqpprox` now understands one vhost mapping. Use `LISTEN` to start listening for connections on port 5673:

```
$ amqpprox_ctl /tmp/amqpprox LISTEN START 5673
```

An AMQP 0.9.1 client can now connect to `vhost-example` on port 5673 and `amqpprox` will forward to `rabbit1` on port 5672.


## Building

The default build uses the Conan package manager, make, cmake and will require
a C++17 compiler. These should be installed prior to doing the native build,
and conan will download the other dependencies during setup.

Once you have set up the build dependencies on your machine, the project should
be buildable with the following commands:

1. `make setup` - This will initialise your Conan environment and create the build
   directory. It should only needs to be run the first time you are setting up
   a build, except when bumping the dependency versions.
2. `make init` - This will do the cmake initialisation, so should be run when
   changing the files included in the project, or the build system.
3. `make` - This will run an incremental build and unit-test

We also provide Dockerfiles for building and running in an isolated
environment, these are directly analogous to the above commands. If you don't
wish to get Conan set up on your build machine, this can be an alternative
quick way to get going.

1. `make docker-setup`
2. `make docker-init`
3. `make docker-build`
4. `make docker-shell`: Get an interactive shell within the build environment
   container.

There are a number of options exposed through the build system, they're
documented on the [buildfiles README](buildfiles/README.md).

We only recommend using Linux based operating systems for running amqpprox;
however, we also regularly develop it on Mac OS and expect changes to not break
the native build there.

By default the build doesn't contain debug symbols, for Debug one can make use of the 
`CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS='-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug'` environment, for Release optimisations 
one can set this to `CMAKE_EXTRA_ARGS='-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release'` 

We can also generate doxygen documentation for C++ classes.
- `make docs`: This command will run doxygen, which is currently configured to dump generated files into `generated-docs/`.
