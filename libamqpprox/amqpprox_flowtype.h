/* \brief Which side of the proxy is being serviced with a particular flow
 *
 * This describes the direction of the data flow with respect to the proxy.
 * The `INGRESS` direction is for flows originating from the proxies'
 * clients and `EGRESS` is for data originating (ie pushed) from the broker.
 * Note that AMQP is in most cases fully bi-directional, so there's no clear
 * request-response linkage between data flows. As such, most interactions in
 * the proxy are symmetric and pass-through but initiated by either the broker
 * or the client, and this identifies which direction the packets came from.
 *
 *     ----------          ---------          -------------------
 *     |        | INGRESS  |       |  EGRESS  |                 |
 *     | Client |<-------->| Proxy |<-------->| RabbitMQ Broker |
 *     |        |          |       |          |                 |
